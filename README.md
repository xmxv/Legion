This repository is OLD, I wrote this over 2 years ago during covid. 

The original base used was a pretty basic bot with 10-20 commands that I took from some open source project on github. This version is an improved modular bot with 100+ commands. 

Dashboard was ripped from another repo and I never bothered getting it to work with my bot. If you end up using this, you will need to update it to work with the new discord.js version + update some of the code to respect the new bot development TOS. 

If you have any issues, please don't create an issue on the repository as I will not be fixing it. 

If you have any questions, feel free to join the discord, also checkout my new project while you're at it.
